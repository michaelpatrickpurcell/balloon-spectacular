# Extended pitch outline

1) **Competitive Spirit (Core Tension)** - Everyone wants the to achieve the same objective, i.e. get their balloons in the best positions in the formation, but only one player can be best. It's king of the mountain! There are several rules that reinforce this tension.
   - Balloons are never allowed to be side-by-side or directly above one another. [Demonstrate this in TTS]
   - Player colours are kept secret, so you'll need to deduce what colors the other players have been assigned.
   - Each balloon has two colours, so you can't be sure how your actions might affect other players. 

2) **Simplicity** - Aloft is easy to play and quick to set up and put away.
   - On each turn, a player does two things: move a truck and advance a balloon.
   - Set up involves: laying out the board, placing the trucks in postiion, and dealing a random colour card to each player.

3) **Beauty** - Aloft is both beautiful and versatile.
   - The way the board state evolves during a game of Aloft captures some of that beauty of real-life hot-air balloons in an experience that anyone can enjoy from the comfort of their own home.
   - Because it requires only a small number of cards (as few as 18 can suffice) and a game board, Aloft can be made as a low-cost, small-box game.
   - Alternatively, by using a magnetic board and balloon tiles, Aloft can be made as a deluxe vertical game with commanding table presence.
