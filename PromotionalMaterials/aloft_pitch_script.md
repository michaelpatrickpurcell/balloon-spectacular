Aloft is a lightweight strategy game about hot-air ballooning.

During the game, players will oversee a mass ascension at a balloon festival and try
to ensure that their balloons end up in the best positions in the resulting formation.

It is imperative that the balloons do not drift too close to one another in flight,
so both time and space will be in short supply. Players will need to try to block their
opponents' balloons while simultaneously advancing their own.

When the game begins, each player will be secretly assigned a random colour
that determines which balloons will contribute to their score at the end of the game.
Players will need to try to deduce which colours their opponents have been assigned
in order to outmanouvre them and, ultimately, claim victory.

Aloft's innovative mechanics are tightly coupled to its unique theme.
This allows players to create a beautiful picture as they play which is
reminiscent of what they might see at a real-life balloon festival.
